# score-keeper
A simple mobile app that allows a user to enter team names, and track scores. Part of coursework from my time in the Mobile App Development and Security curriculum through GRCC.

This app allows a user to input the name of two different teams. That name is reflected on the score tracking display where they are able to push individual buttons to keep track of a total score. Once these scores are put in, the user will be able to log a date, submit the score, and both teams' scores as well as the date logged will be showing on the following screen. The final display of this app is a work in progress display of both teams' rosters, mostly used for practice with the ScrollView component.
